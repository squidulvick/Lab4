@file encoder_reader.py
This file contains the class implementation for reading the values on the ME 405 microcontroller
and ametek pittman motors.  This file also contains testing code to test if the encoder can be read,
if the encoder can handle overflows both positively and negatively, and if the encoder can be zeroed.
